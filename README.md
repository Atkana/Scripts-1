# TES3MP-TeamFOSS â€“ TES3MP script repository

A collection of free/libre open source TES3MP scripts.

These scripts are intended to use with version `0.7.0-alpha` and are

## Installation instructions

1. Copy the contents of `lib` into your `CoreScripts/lib` directory.
2. Place your favoured mods in `CoreScripts/mods`.
